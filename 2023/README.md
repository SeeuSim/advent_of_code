## Day 1 - Trebuchet

### Part 1 - Simple Digits

Given a list of strings ([file](/src/day_1/input.txt)), parse the leftmost **singular** digit (0 - 9),
and the rightmost **singular** digit (0-9) in each line, and combine them into a number like so:

```rs
use std::fmt::format;

let first_digit = 1;
let last_digit = 2;
let num = format!("{}{}", first_digit, last_digit)
    .parse::<u32>()
    .unwrap(); // 12
  ```

In the event that the line only has one digit, that digit is the leftmost AND the rightmost digit.

Take the sum of all the numbers formed in this manner, for each line.

### Part 2 - Digits Including Words (and overlapping ones)

An extension of the above, just that now, any **lowercase** English alphabets that spell out numbers
(i.e. 'one', 'two', ..., 'nine') also form valid digits.

This proved quite tricky, since strings like these: "twoneightwone" have overlapping numbers that 
are hard to find with regular regex capture groups.

I initially attempted to use the `fancy_regex` crate to provide pattern matching for reverse lookups
(i.e. `r"(?<=(one))`) and so on, but after watching 
[Christopher Biscardi's video](https://youtu.be/JOgQMjpGum0?si=u-UR2ILMLUbJJuux),
I discovered that Rust iterators provide a faster lookup (by 1000x) by simply performing:

- a sliding window on the line with step of 1 and
- comparing if each window starts with the "one", "two", etc. or parsing the first char as a digit.

It also makes use of the `filter_map` iterator function to filter out results which resulted in Errors
from the parsing of the first char as a digit where:

- the slice did not start with a lowercase spelling of a digit in English.

## Day 2 - Cube Conundrum

### Part 1 - Indexes of valid games

Given a list of strings ([file](/src/day_2/input.txt)), each line is made up of a pattern
representing a game like so:

`Game {index}: x red, y blue, z green; x_0 red, y_0 blue, z_0 green; ...`

Each game consists of a set of values (`x red, y blue, z green`) separated by a semicolon (';').
In each set, if:

- the number of red exceeds 12, or

- the number of blue exceeds 13, or

- the number of green exceeds 14,

then that set indicates that the game is not possible and that line is invalid.

The goal is to sum up the indices (1 indexed) of all the valid lines.

### Part 2 - Product of minimum cubes needed for a game

This adapts from Part 1 by processing the minimum number of cubes (red, blue, green) needed
for each set so that the number of cubes for each color in each set does not exceed this minimum
number.

Then, take the product of the three minimum numbers for each line, and sum up all the lines.

This involved a bit more processing to keep it within the Rust iterators, so I used a HashMap
to:

- accumulate the maximum value seen for each cube color across the sets for each line, and

- take their values as an iterable and fold them multiplicatively, and

- fold all the products across the lines into one sum.

## Day 3 - Gear Ratios

### Part 1 - Sum all parts adjacent to components

Given a list of strings ([file](/src/day_3/input.txt)), each line is made up of a pattern
representing a game like so:

```txt
...122..................*.....*..........
....+..........259....698..373.992.52.674
```

In each line, there are some numbers representing part numbers. If a part is adjacent to
a component (any non-'.' character), then take its part number.

Accumulate the sum of all part numbers.

I used a simple approach to check all neighboring characters around a captured number, and
if it was valid, I took its value.

Else, I took a value of 0 to represent not taking the number, and I summed up all the numbers
in this manner.

### Part 2 - Sum of all gear ratios of gears adjacent to two parts only

This adapts from part 1 by taking all gears "*" which have only 2 parts that are adjacent to them
as per the rules above, and multiplying their part numbers to form the gear ratio.

Then, sum up all the gear ratios of these gears to form the answer.

I adapted the approach from part 1 to find all gears a part was adjacent to, and memoize the
part under a list of parts for each gear in the list.

I then filtered out the gears which only had 2 adjacent parts, multiplied their part numbers to
form the ratio, and took the sum.

Also, as I had to repeatedly access line character indices to check them across neighboring lines,
I had to extract out the line characters from their iterators into memory to allow repeated access
as opposed to using the `chars()` iterator, which only allows access to an index **once**.

## Day 4 - Scratchcards

### Part 1 - Points from winning sets

Given a line in the below format:

```text
Card   1:  8 86 59 90 68 52 55 24 37 69 | 10 55  8 86  6 62 69 68 59 37 91 90 24 22 78 61 58 89 52 96 95 94 13 36 81
```

The task was to parse all the numbers on the left as a set of winning numbers, then for each line calculate:

- How many cards on the right of the pipe ("|") lie in this set

- For the number of winning cards, calculate the number of points, with:

  - 0 getting no points,

  - 1 onwards getting $2^{\text{count}-1}$ points.

This was trivial enough to calculate, and obtain the sum of all points obtained. 

### Part 2 - Number of cards won

For each of the cards in part 1, each of the cards are already obtained by the player
as 1 copy each.

If, for instance, Card 1 wins 10 numbers, then the player gets 1 additional copy of
the next 10 cards (Card 2 and so on).

Since now we have 2 copies of Card 2, if Card 2 wins 2 numbers, then each of the 
copies of Card 2 now win 2 copies of the next 2 cards (Cards 3 and 4), for a total
of 4 additional cards.

We are now tasked with calculating the number of cards the player ends up with.

Taking inspiration from Christopher Biscardi again, we initialise the count
of each card as 1 in a `BTreeMap` as we are guaranteed to traverse the indices
from low to high always,

and we use the cards won from part 1 to modify the counts in this counter map.

We also increment each of the subsequent cards won by the number of cards the current card has (in the case of Card 2 above, 2).

## Day 5 - Planting Seeds (Range Queries)

### Part 1 - Mapping Singular Values and finding minimum

Given a set of range maps each with a set of entries, like so (this is one range
map):

```text
3305253869 1699909104 39566623
3344820492 1130725752 384459310
3244681427 1739475727 60572442
951517531 1800048169 868898709
1820416240 951517531 179208221
1999624461 2668946878 219310925
3729279802 1515185062 184724042
2218935386 2898481077 1015522767
3234458153 2888257803 10223274
```
For each line, it is formatted in the format (`dest_start`, `source_start`, `length`).

This implies that the mapping of any value in the range
$[\text{source\_start, source\_start+length}]$
will be mapped to the range
$[\text{dest\_start, dest\_start+length}]$
in a 1:1 mapping.

For instance, if we have (2, 5, 3), we would have 5 mapped to 2, 6 mapped to 3 and 7
mapped to 4 for a length of 3 elements. 

Any elements that fall outside any of the source ranges will be mapped to themselves
in the output.

This constitutes one set of mappings, with each number from a **source** to a
**destination**.

---

After a set of source-to-destination mappings, we arrive at our final mapped numbers
and return the minimum value.

This is trivial enough to perform the iterative mapping for each seed value.

### Part 2 - Mapping a Set of Ranges and finding minimum value

This adapts Part 1 by converting each pair of seeds into: $(\text{seed\_range\_start},\text{range\_length})$.

Then, for each number in the range, find the mappings as per Part 1 and find the minimum
output number.

This is not practical as the ranges can number in the billions. Hence, an approach is needed where we process each set in the following manner, for each input seed range:

- For each mapping in the set, find the intersection of the mapping with the
  input seed range. This entire range can be mapped.

- Find the portion of the input seed range that does not intersect. This range
  maps to itself.

- Take all the mapped ranges and dedupe them so that they do not intersect.

We repeat this for all the sets of mappings, and then find the minimum range by
start point.

This was inspired by GitHub user @sergiocarvalho-soomacom.

## Day 6 - Wait For It

### Part 1 - Basic time trial per race

This simply maps for each time total, a range from 1 to the time, subtract 
the index and multiply it by the remaining time for the distance travelled.

As the input numbers are small, no optimisations are needed.

### Part 2 - Accumulating all values into one

As the number is less than 1 billion, the same approach can be taken with
little to no performance penalty.

### Optimisations

There can be optimisations, but they are only really necessary with larger
numbers.

## Day 7 - Camel Cards

### Part 1 - Parsing of hands and comparing them

This requires for hands to be parsed, and compared against one another.
I opted to store the hands as a struct, containing:

1. Their classified kind, for comparison

2. Their raw hand values, for disputing

3. Their bets, for calculating the sum.

This now simply requires the implementation of the parsing logic,
the comparison logic, as well as the collecting of results.

#### Parsing Logic

We need to parse the string, as well as classify it.

We implement the `from_str` method to parse it, and depending
on the different char counts, classify the hand type.

#### Comparator Logic

We simply compare the kind, and if the hand kind matches,
we compare the character order index by index.

### Part 2 - Comparing hands with Joker swaps

This alters the parsing and classification logic, to classify
the hand after taking the Joker, if any, to improve the hand
value.

We then modified the `from_str` method to take this hand kind
classification into account.

This also alters the comparison logic by reducing the index of the
joker to the lowest. We simply swapped the order to prioritise
Joker to the lowest value.

## Day 8 - Haunted Wasteland 

### Part 1 - Counting steps to reach 'ZZZ' from 'AAA' for a single node 

Given a graph with nodes containing 'left' and 'right' pointers, calculate
the number of steps required, following a cyclic set of instructions
'L' or 'R' to reach the 'ZZZ' node from 'AAA',

This is a simple linked-list traversal that takes less than 2^15 steps.

### Part 2 - Counting steps for multiple nodes to reach destination ending with 'Z' _simultaneously_ 

As this changes the start node to all nodes ending with 'A', there are multiple nodes
to take into consideration.

As each node takes a different number of steps to reach the first destination node ending
with 'Z', we can first investigate with two of the nodes.

As it turns out, for the first two nodes, they both reach a node ending with 'Z' when the
step count reaches the lowest common multiple of their individual step counts.

Investigating this, combining the first node with each of the other nodes ending with 'A',
we find that this relation holds true.

Hence, we combine all the step counts into their LCM and obtain the answer.

## Day 9 - Mirage Maintenance

### Part 1 - Extrapolate forwards

For this part, the goal was to take each line,
a sequence of numbers, and generate new lines
each made up of the pairwise difference of 
adjacent elements of the line above, like so:

```text
1 2 3 4 5
 1 1 1 1
  0 0 0
```

In this case, the original line is the first,
and the desired extrapolated values can
be obtained by summing the entire right edge 
formed by '5', '1' and '0'.

This was easily doable with iterators and vector
operations.

The answer was the sum of all extrapolated values.

### Part 2 - Extrapolate backwards

This extends from part 1 by extrapolating backwards
and predicting the value preceding the first.

In the example in Part 1, it is clear that the 
extrapolated value is 0.

The adjustment made was to take a rightwards fold
of all sequences generated, subtracting the accumulated
value from the next.

Using the above diagram in Part 1 as an example,
it would start from the first element of the last line
('0'), taking $1 - 0 = 1$ for the next line, and $1 - 1 = 0$ for the
initial line to obtain the final value of 0.


## Day 10 - Pipe Maze 

### Part 1 - Furthest Point 

Using a loop and the direction pointers, I looped around until
I ended up back at 'S'.

Using the total iteration count divided by 2, would obtain the furthest
distance along the loop from 'S'.

### Part 2 - Area Within 

This was slightly more involved.

Using the same logic as earlier, I kept track of all visited positions
along the loop.

Then, I iterated over each character, to iterate from the beginning,
how many inversions of the loop there were.

An inversion occurs when a vertical pipe is encountered, or a 'J' or 'L' is encountered.
These signify either exiting a west-north bend, entering the loop, or entering a
north-east bend, going along a straight and possibly out of the loop.

This gives some slight over-counting by 6. I verified this using other solutions
online, like this one: [link](https://github.com/hyper-neutrino/advent-of-code/blob/main/2023/day10p2.py),
and implemented that logic in the function `pipe_maze_two`, which I will explain [below](#working-solution).

I left the original, broken, solution in the function `broken_pipe_maze_two`.

#### Working Solution

It functions largely similarly to the original, just replacing the 'S' with its possible characters,
and replacing all non-loop characters with '.' to minimise confusion.

Then, to count inversions by crossing the vertical characters, it iterates over each row, finding
vertical characters and marking as within/not-within the loop.

It also avoids the 'L----J' and 'L-----7' branches by setting a flag if a 'L' or 'F' pipe has first
been encountered, to count if the ending character of the bend is a 'J' or a '7', and hence if to
count the crossing of the last character as an inversion or not.

If for instance it is an 'L----J', then effectively two inversions have been made and nothing changes.
Else, only one inversion has been made, and the state storing if the chars are within the loop can
be inverted.

Any time it is not within the loop, the characters are added to the 'outside' set, and the union
of the 'outside' set with the pipe loop set gives the total number of characters that are pipes
or not in the loop.

Subtracting the total number of characters from this union gives the total number of characters
that are within the loop.

## Day 11 - Cosmic Expansion

### Part 1 - Expanding manually and sum of all pairs shortest paths

Simply iterate through each line, doubling the rows where needed and
doubling columns (from reverse to keep indices intact) where needed as well.

Then, I iteratively used pairings of each galaxy to calculate the row and
column difference between their indices for the shortest path sum.

### Part 2 - Expanding using math and sum of all pairs shortest paths

Since the row expansion factor was by a million, this could potentially
slow the calculations down.

Hence, I used manual calculations to calculate and insert a million
rows/columns for each expanded row/column per path sum.

## Day 12 - Hot Springs

### Part 1 - Number of ways to fit configuration into springs

This involved iterating down each line with pointers across two iterators,
the first being the line itself, and the second being the groups of springs.

### Part 2 - Increasing pattern length

This involved simply repeating the pattern from part 1 5 times, and increasing
the output range from i32 to i64.

## Day 13 - Point of Incidence

### Part 1 - Find horizontal or vertical line of reflection

Iterating through the pattern, starting from different start columns or rows,
for vertical and horizontal reflections respectively, we compare each character
with its reflection about the line of reflection.

If we find a line index which causes a valid reflection, then that line index is
taken as the line of reflection, and the score is as such.

### Part 2 - Find line with one replacement

This iterates from the previous part by first obtaining the original score,
and using the coordinates from the previous part as a banned set of positions,
to iterate through each row and column, replacing each character and finding the
first alternate line of reflection.

This uses a sort of 'backtracking' approach to make the modification and backtrack
once the calculation is made.

## Day 14 - Parabolic Reflector Dish

### Part 1 - Tilting North and Counting score

For this part, I took inspiration from hyper neutrino again, and implemented a
simple function to tilt the grid north.

Then, I used another function to simply count the number of 'O's in each row
and get the total score for that row, summing up the scores from all the rows.

### Part 2 - Tilting in all directions, for 1,000,000,000 times

TO BE IMPLEMENTED

Disclaimer: I used hyperneutrino's solution for this, and am still not entirely
sure how to obtain the actual correct solution using Rust.

## Day 15 - Lens Library

### Part 1 - Obtain Hash Codes

For this, all that was needed was some folding logic to calculate the hash
score according to specifications.

### Part 2 - Place Lens Filters and Calculate scores

For this, a bit more iteration was needed, but by simply pre-allocating
the vector of boxes and inserting/updating/removing the lenses as specified,
the score is obtained by multiplying the box index with the refractive index
of each lens, their position within the box, and summing them all up.

## Day 16 - The Floor Will Be Lava

### Part 1 - Calculating Visited Cells in Grid

For this part, the answer is simply the total number of visited cells in the grid,
by exploring the grid.

Each cell may be explored up to 1 time in each of the directions.

However, as the answer is only keen on counting the total number of explored cells,
we strip the visited delta from each cell and only count the total number of unique cells.

### Part 2 - Calculating Optimal Start Point for Grid

For this part, we use the score obtaining function from part 1 and iterate through all
possible starting positions to obtain the maximum score.

## Day 17 - Clumsy Crucible

### Part 1 - Shortest Path with max 3 consec. jumps per direction

For this, a simple Djikstra's algorithm with minimum heap was needed to
implement the shortest path search.

A custom struct with ordering was needed to work effectively with the
binary heap struct.

Then, custom loop logic was needed for each iteration to add forward
jumps only if there were allowance (less than 3) remaining in that
direction.

Jumps in other directions were also needed to kickstart the exploration
of paths in other directions.

By virtue of the priority queue, nodes with the shortest total path cost
will be explored first and it is guaranteed that the first time the 
destination cell is hit, the cost returned is the lowest.

### Part 2 - Minimum 4, Maximum 10 jumps per direction

This simply altered the logic of the previous part by tweaking the forward
exploration limit to 10 jumps, and the exploration of other directions to
only the start node, as well as when at least 4 jumps were made.

## Day 18 - Lavaduct Lagoon

### Part 1 - Parsing values from left

For this part, parsing the values from the left of the pattern was
relatively straightforward.

To form the polygon vertices, it suffices to iterate through the
instructions, multiplying the deltas by the distance of each instruction,
then accumulating the coordinates to get the next vertice coordinate.

Then, to get the polygon area, it suffices to use the shoelace method
to obtain the polygon area.

However, as the polygon is not a regular shape, this eats into the
circumference. Hence, we use Pick's theorem to obtain the internal area
comprising all internal integers of the polygon.

Then, adding the circumference, we obtain the total area.

### Part 2 - Parsing values from end

To simplify parsing the hex values from the end of each instruction,
we used a regex capture to capture only the needed characters, then
split them, taking the last character as the direction, while the front
5 characters as a hex digit using the `u64::from_str_radix` function.

As the values are relatively larger, annotation of types to `u64` and `i64`
are needed to prevent overflow.

As we used a mathematical method for the previous part, no space constraints
were needed for this one.

## Day 19 - Aplenty

### Part 1 - Processing each part individually

Given a list of workflows, I defined a custom struct for each workflow, and
a custom struct for each Rule for a separation of concerns on which struct
handled what responsibility.

I also designed a Part struct as a logical grouping for the JSON object with 
'x', 'm', 'a', and 's' keys.

Using the parsing logic, and providing a `process` function on each workflow
to evaluate each `Part`, I was able to quickly classify if each part was
to be accepted or not, and perform the relevant sums.

### Part 2 - Processing all possible combinations of ranges

This was slightly trickier as there was a large number of ranges, to the
${10}^{14}$, and processing each combination of values
would be rather costly.

Hence, I used a set of range computations, and partitioned
them according to pass or fail ranges for each rule.

Then, for those that got passed and redirected, I recursively
processed them until they ended in rejected or accepted ranges.

Using this base state, I summed up all the possible counts.

Given the limited set of rules, the depth of this recursion
tree was not too deep, and the computation was near instantaneous.

## Day 20 - Pulse Propagation

### Part 1 - 1000 cycles

For this, I first initialised all conjunction modules to register all their
linked input flip flops.

Then, I iterated through the loops of pressing the button and then processing
all downstream modules, one by one. Once a loop that ended with all the modules
at their starting state, the end of the cycle was recorded, and the number of
iterations was then multiplied by the number of times each cycle of iterations
is needed to make 1000 iterations.

### Part 2 - Cycling until `rx` is hit

(Inspired by hyperneutrino)

Initially, I tried a simple break condition, but it appeared that the number
was so huge that another solution was needed.

As there was only one node which could send the requisite signal to the 'rx'
node, we needed to keep a lookout for which nodes could send the requisite
'high' signal to that node, so that it can send the requisite 'low' signal
to the 'rx' node.

Then, after keeping track of the cycles of iterations needed to reach each
of the requisite 'grandparent' nodes, the LCM of all of the iteration
counts required for each of the grandparent nodes would then give the
number of iterations to send the signal to the 'rx' node.

## Day 21 - Step Counter

### Part 1 - Counting cells reachable in n steps

In this portion, we use a form of BFS to explore the grid, starting from the start
coordinates.

As long as we reach a step count that matches if the given step count mod 2, we add
that to the qualified set as the gardener can always either take the number of steps
to reach the cells, or backtrack along their path to the cells reached earlier along
the path, like so:

```sh
# Odd
# | S | step_1 | step_2 | step_3
#
# Even
# | S | step_1 | step_2
```

In these cases, when the steps specified are odd, say 3, the gardener can always go back
to step_1, from step_2 (instead of heading to step_3). In this case, both step_1 and step_3's
shortest distance from S have the same modulo with respect to 2.

By extension, this will also work for an even number of steps.

### Part 2 - Counting cells reachable in an infinite grid, with millions of steps

For this part, they specify a large step count, or the size of the original grid multiplied by
2023.

We can think of the expanded grid like a giant square rotated by 45 degrees. Given that the number
of steps that are allowed is a multiple of the grid length by 2023, we can traverse up to 2023 grids
directly in each direction, from the start coordinates which happen to be in the center of the grid,
which also happens to be a square.

```sh
# <| | | ... 2022 grids | S
```

As shown, up to 2022 grids external to the start grid can be traversed from the start coordinates,
in each direction. The 2023rd grid length is reserved for traversing from the start position to the
edge of the first grid, as well as the half grid corner at the edge.

We can then calculate the number of grids that are external to the start grid, by taking the floor
division of the number of steps divided by the length of the start grid, and subtract one from that.
(Excluding the start grid)

#### Odd and Even Grids

Then, to count the cells in entire grids that are reachable from the start grid, we can segment them
by either grids which take an odd number of steps from the start coordinates, and grids which take
an even number of steps from the start coordinates:

```sh
# | g_odd | g_even | S | g_even | g_odd
```

As shown, as our grid length happens to be odd, it would take an even number of steps from our start
coordinates (65 + 131) to reach the edge of the grids adjacent to our start grid, as well as every other
alternating grid after that. Conversely, for every other grid that is 2 grids away from the start grid,
they take an odd number of steps (65 + 2k * 131) to reach their farthest edges from the start coordinates.

The number of odd step grids can be calculated by the square of the number of grids rounded up to the
nearest odd number.

This **_number of grids_** is the $(\frac{\text{steps}}{\text{grid width}} - 1)$ taken earlier.

Likewise, the number of even grids is the square of the number of grids rounded down to the nearest even number. We then multiply
these respective numbers by the number of cells explorable in a
single grid, with even and odd step numbers respectively.

#### Corners

If the 2023 grids per side adjacent to the start coordinates are
laid out in a cross and the gaps are filled, these would form the
corners of the large diamond diagram. As we earlier only counted
the cells in grids adjacent to the starting grid, these corners and more are left out.

For the corners, the calculations are somewhat special. These simply
calculate for each side of the grid, the number of cells that can be explored if you start from the middle of an edge and make your way
towards the middle of the opposing edge, traversing a maximum of 
the length of the grid in terms of steps.

#### Diagonal Edges

For each of the remaining diagonal edges, two types of cells remain,
namely the small triangles, and the big triangles:

```txt
  |\
  | \
  ----
  |  \
  |   \
  -----
```

To calculate the number of cells reachable in each of these types of
cells, the small triangles can be treated as 1/8th of a grid,
while the larger trapezoid is more like a grid square with the smaller triangle lopped off.

For each of these, we can start from the bottom corner,
and provide $(\text{grid width}\div 2)$ steps for the smaller
triangles, or $(\text{grid width}\times 3\div 2)$ steps for the
larger trapezoids.

Along each edge, there can be up to half the width of the large grid's worth of the larger trapezoids, and the same plus one 
for the number of smaller triangles.

#### Answer

Taking the sum of all these, we obtain our answer.

## Day 22 - Sand Slabs

### Part 1 - Counting which bricks can be taken out safely

We first sorted the bricks so that those with the lowest z coordinates,
or height, were in front first, then sorted by y coordinates, and then x coordinates.

This allowed us to iterate over the stack of bricks, settling them and recording the new
height of the bricks before further processing took place.

Then, to process the bricks, we simply removed each brick and filtered which one would cause
the now removed stack to have none of the bricks drop. By taking the count of these bricks,
the answer is obtained.

### Part 2 - Counting how many bricks will drop for each removed brick

This simply required tweaking the result function to count the number of dropped bricks, and
sum the count of all bricks dropped, per brick.

## Day 23 - A Long Walk

### Part 1 - Longest Path with Slope Restriction

Using the maze, we constructed a summarised graph to simulate a DAG, of the maze's points of interest,
namely the points which have at least three points of inflection.

Then, we iteratively explore the map from each of these points until we reach all other points in the graph,
forming a sort of DAG for the points of interest. This records the distance between each of the points of 
interest. This exploration is restricted when we encounter slopes.

Then, we iterate from the start point towards the end point in the graph, and add the longest distance
between each point along the way from the start to the end.

### Part 2 - Longest Path without Slope Restriction

While simply removing the slope restriction from part 1 should do the trick, we unfortunately cannot
get the correct answer (6695 vs 6378).

TO BE IMPLEMENTED: Explore how to get correct ans in Rust.

## Day 24 - Never Tell Me the Odds

### Part 1 - Count Pairwise Intersections

For this part, I took inspiration from [cranil](https://github.com/cranil/aoc2023-rs)'s repo.

I had already gotten the indices and parsing of the stones. However, my intersection calculations
were not working, and hence I borrowed Cranil's functions to solve for my intersections.

Let each position $P_x$, $P_y$ be expressed as a function of $x,y$ and its vector $V_x, V_y$:

$$
\begin{align*}
P_x &= x + k\cdot V_x \\
P_y &= y + k\cdot V_y \\
\frac{P_x-x}{V_x}&=\frac{P_y-y}{V_y} \\
V_y\cdot P_x - Vx\cdot P_y &= V_y\cdot x - V_x\cdot y \\
ax + by &= c \\
a &= V_y \\
b &= -V_x \\
c &= V_y \cdot x - V_x\cdot y
\end{align*}
$$

By taking the determinant, we can determine if the lines
are parallel and hence if they intersect.

My implementation of this was giving me errors, and I used
Cranil's one which may move around the computations
slightly.

TO BE IMPLEMENTED: Using LINALG LIB

### Part 2 - Calculate Singular Intersecting Vector

Again, I used Cranil's implementation for this, and
reworded the variables to make it slightly clearer. I
still do not fully understand the code.

It takes the first three stones and attempts to solve
for the plane in which the three stones' paths intersect.

After some calculations, a system of equations is formed,
and he solves it to obtain the resultant vector.

He then tries different combinations of subtracting
various deltas from the resultant vector's position
and velocity, and once the vector product of the
position deltas and the velocity deltas match, the
resultant vector is formed.

## Day 25 - Snowverload

### Finding minimum cut

For this puzzle, they require us to find the minimum cut that
partitions the graph into two partitions of maximum size.

For this attempt, I took inspiration from Chris Biscardi
and used two crates:

- `petgraph`
- `rustworkx-core`

The petgraph crate was to create an undirected graph in a more
seamless fashion as opposed to using a HashMap and having duplicate
records for bidirectional edges.

Then, we used the rustworkx algorithm which already implemented a
minimum cut for us. Using this cut and measuring the sizes of the
partitions, we obtained the answer by multiplying the two partitions
together.
